```rust
use std::io::{self, Write};
```

### `use std::io::{self, Write};`
- **`use` keyword**: This imports items from a module or crate (a package of Rust code). Here, we're importing from the standard library (`std`), specifically the `io` module.
- **`std::io`**: This module provides input and output (I/O) functionalities. 
- **`{self, Write}`**: We import `io` itself (with `self`), so we can use it directly as `io`, and we also import `Write`, which allows us to flush the output to the console.

```rust
fn main() {
```

### `fn main() {`
- **`fn` keyword**: This defines a function. In Rust, every executable program must have a `main` function. This is where the program starts executing.
- **`main` function**: The entry point of your Rust program.

```rust
    print!("Enter a String to Reverse: ");
    io::stdout().flush().unwrap();
```

### `print!("Enter a String to Reverse: ");`
- **`print!` macro**: This prints text to the console without adding a newline at the end.
- **Macro**: In Rust, macros are like functions but are prefixed with `!`. They generate code at compile time.
- **`"Enter a String to Reverse: "`**: This is the string that gets printed to the console.

### `io::stdout().flush().unwrap();`
- **`io::stdout()`**: This gets a handle to the standard output (your console).
- **`flush()` method**: This forces the output to be written to the console immediately. Sometimes, text printed with `print!` may be buffered, and flushing ensures it's displayed right away.
- **`unwrap()` method**: This is used to handle potential errors. If `flush()` fails, `unwrap()` will cause the program to panic (crash) and display an error message. For beginners, it's a simple way to deal with errors, but later on, you’ll learn more sophisticated ways to handle errors.

```rust
    let mut input = String::new();
```

### `let mut input = String::new();`
- **`let` keyword**: This declares a new variable.
- **`mut` keyword**: This makes the variable mutable, meaning its value can be changed.
- **`input` variable**: This will store the user's input.
- **`String::new()`**: This creates a new, empty string. `String` is a growable, heap-allocated data structure used for storing text.

```rust
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("Failed to read line");
```

### `io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("Failed to read line");`
- **`io::stdin()`**: Gets a handle to the standard input (the console input).
- **`read_line(&mut input)` method**: This reads a full line of input from the user and appends it to the `input` string.
  - **`&mut input`**: We pass a mutable reference to the `input` variable, allowing `read_line` to modify `input` directly.
- **`expect("Failed to read line")` method**: If reading the line fails (e.g., an I/O error), the program will crash, and the error message `"Failed to read line"` will be printed.

```rust
    let input = input.trim();
```

### `let input = input.trim();`
- **`input.trim()`**: This removes any leading or trailing whitespace (like newlines) from the string.
- **`let input =`**: This reassigns the trimmed string to `input`. Note that since we're not using `mut` here, the variable is now immutable.

```rust
    let reversed = reverse_string(input);
```

### `let reversed = reverse_string(input);`
- **`let reversed =`**: Declares a new variable called `reversed`.
- **`reverse_string(input)`**: This calls the `reverse_string` function (defined below), passing `input` as an argument. The result (the reversed string) is stored in `reversed`.

```rust
    println!("Reversed String: {}", reversed);
```

### `println!("Reversed String: {}", reversed);`
- **`println!` macro**: Similar to `print!`, but it adds a newline at the end of the output.
- **`"Reversed String: {}"`**: This is a format string. The `{}` is a placeholder where the value of `reversed` will be inserted.
- **`reversed`**: The reversed string is printed to the console.

```rust
}

fn reverse_string(s: &str) -> String {
    s.chars().rev().collect()
}
```

### `fn reverse_string(s: &str) -> String {`
- **`fn reverse_string`**: Defines a new function named `reverse_string`.
- **`s: &str`**: This function takes one argument, `s`, which is a string slice (a reference to a string).
- **`-> String`**: The function returns a `String`.

### `s.chars().rev().collect()`
- **`s.chars()`**: This converts the string `s` into an iterator over its characters.
- **`rev()` method**: This reverses the order of the characters.
- **`collect()` method**: This collects the reversed characters into a new `String`.

### Explanation of the Flow:
1. **Prompt the User**: The program asks the user to enter a string.
2. **Read Input**: The user’s input is read and stored in the `input` variable.
3. **Trim Input**: Any extra whitespace (like the newline added when the user hits "Enter") is removed.
4. **Reverse the String**: The `reverse_string` function is called, which reverses the characters in the string.
5. **Output the Result**: The reversed string is printed to the console.

### Key Concepts:
- **Ownership and Borrowing**: Rust has strict rules about how memory is managed. In this code, `input` is passed by reference to avoid unnecessary copying.
- **Error Handling**: The `expect` method is a basic way to handle errors. It will terminate the program if something goes wrong.
- **Immutability**: Variables are immutable by default in Rust, meaning once they are set, they cannot be changed unless explicitly marked with `mut`.

This code demonstrates some fundamental Rust concepts like handling input/output, working with strings, and defining functions. Keep practicing, and these concepts will become second nature!
